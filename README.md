# Shirley's Tech Blog 
    This is my blog (or notes) about issues occuring during my learning process.
    It's going to cover Java basics, databases, algorithms, networks...
    Everything will be in English!ðŸ™‚

## Here Are They:
#### [Java Basics](./java.md)
    I've done a lot of exercise before, It's time for combining knowledge now.

#### [Databases](./databases.md)
    What's database?
    Nowadays we have a lot of databases, and each has different features.
    I think we should not only learn mysql or redis, we should have a view on Bigdata:
    Hadoop, Kafka, Hbase, Spark, Hive...

#### [English](./english.md)
    You know that I love English learning, especially British English.
    Before I never made up my mind to learn it regularly.
    But with the feeling of losing my English ability, I'll take this time!
